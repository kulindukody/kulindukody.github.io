Hey everyone 👋
I’m **Kulindu Kodithuwakku**, a **Red Team Engineer** with hands-on experience in **offensive security, malware development, red teaming, and Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)**.

My work focuses on simulating real-world adversary techniques to help organizations understand their true security posture. I’ve been actively involved in areas such as **internal and external penetration testing, Active Directory attacks, privilege escalation, command-and-control tradecraft, malware analysis and development (for ethical purposes), and attack path validation**. I’m particularly interested in how modern attackers operate and how defenses can be realistically tested and improved.

Alongside technical assessments, I place strong emphasis on **clear reporting, risk prioritization, and actionable remediation**, ensuring that findings are meaningful to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

You can explore my work, labs, and projects here:

I’m available for **freelance Red Team engagements, VAPT projects, security assessments, and consulting work**. Feel free to reach out if you’re looking to test, validate, or strengthen your security posture.
