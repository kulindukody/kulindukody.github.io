# Intro to Malware Development
---
## What is Malware
Malware in the simplest terms is **Malicious Software**, This is simply any program that's designed to do something that is **bad or unwanted** on a system without the permission of the user.

Simply, you can consider normal software to be someone helpful that you will invite to your house. whereas malware is like someone sneaking in through a window in your house and rearranging your furniture or stealing your TV or maybe installing secret cameras to monitor you.

## Why would you develop Malware
So there are a couple of reasons but ill focus more on the red team perspective of things, so writing a malware isn't about causing damage in a network or a device its about realistically testing the security posture in an organization so an organization can focus and fix on what actually matters.

As one wise man once said:
You may focus on the logical way of getting into an house which is obviously through the door, but an attacker will never try the logical way he might just try the windows if your building is not secure.

So in that case the malware is like the assessment we run through the window.
## What are the Prerequisites to start Malware Development
Well there are a few prerequisites that would be ideal for malware development. Starting from the most critical prerequisite.
1. Critical Thinking
2. C++ / C Programming
3. Understanding of Shellcode
4. Command and Control Servers
5. Windows Internals
6. Understanding of how Windows works

So with this understanding you can start malware development, Do i know all of this. Well **NO**. that's why you guys are here to join me through this journey in learning malware development.

With that see you in the next blog.
